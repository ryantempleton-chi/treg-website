            <h2 class="section-heading">clarity in a fast-moving market</h2>

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              Chicago rentals move quickly, and every building, landlord, and listing can handle things a little
              differently. Our job is to bring structure to that chaos — so you stay organized and confident, even when
              the market is moving fast.
            </p>

            <p style="max-width: 880px;">
              Here’s the general process we follow with rental clients. We’ll tailor the pace based on timing, budget,
              and how competitive your target neighborhoods are — and we’ll help you move decisively without feeling
              rushed.

            <h2 class="section-heading">step-by-step: renting with the templeton real estate group</h2>

            <ol style="padding-left: 1.1rem; max-width: 820px;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 1: Initial consult</strong><br />
                We’ll align on move-in date, budget, preferred neighborhoods, and must-haves — pets, parking, in-unit
                laundry, amenities, building type, and commute.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 2: Search strategy &amp; expectations</strong><br />
                We’ll set realistic expectations for what your budget will get you (and where), explain common fees and
                requirements, and map out a game plan for how aggressively to search.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 3: Curate options</strong><br />
                Instead of endless links, you’ll get a clean shortlist of listings that match your criteria — and honest
                feedback on what’s worth seeing (and what isn’t).
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 4: Schedule and tour efficiently</strong><br />
                We coordinate showings with buildings, landlords, and listing agents — stacking tours when possible so
                you can see multiple options in one efficient window of time.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 5: Compare and choose</strong><br />
                We’ll help you compare options based on layout, building rules, commute, value, and trade-offs that
                matter — without pressure. The goal is a confident decision.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 6: Apply</strong><br />
                When you’re ready, we’ll walk you through the application process: what documents you’ll need, typical
                fees, and how to submit quickly and cleanly.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 7: Approval, deposits, and lease review</strong><br />
                We’ll help you understand approval timelines, move-in fees vs. security deposits, and key lease terms
                so you know what you’re signing and what’s expected before move-in.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 8: Final logistics &amp; move-in</strong><br />
                We’ll confirm move-in steps (elevator reservations, utility setup, building rules, and day-one logistics)
                so your transition feels organized and predictable.
              </li>

              <p>
                The “sweet spot” for most Chicago rentals is typically 30–60 days before your ideal move-in date — but
                it depends on building type, neighborhood, and seasonality.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you’re earlier than that, we can still help you map out neighborhoods, budgets, and expectations so
                you’re ready when listings start to match your timing.

        <!-- FAQ -->
        <section class="section section-muted">
          <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-heading">common renting questions</h2>

            <div style="max-width: 860px;">
              <p>
                <strong>How soon should I start looking?</strong><br />
                Most rentals are listed 30–60 days before move-in. In some cases (especially in spring/summer), good
                units go fast — so we’ll recommend a timeline based on your target areas and must-haves.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What do I need to apply?</strong><br />
                Many landlords require photo ID, proof of income, and a credit/background check. Requirements vary by
                building, so we’ll confirm exactly what you’ll need before you tour.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Do landlords require a security deposit?</strong><br />
                Some do, but many Chicago buildings use a move-in fee instead. We’ll explain what’s typical for the
                properties you’re considering.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>How quickly do I need to decide?</strong><br />
                In competitive pockets, sometimes same-day decisions matter. We’ll help you tour strategically and be
                ready to move quickly when it’s the right fit.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Can you help if I’m relocating to Chicago?</strong><br />
                Yes — we can do virtual tours, preview options, and keep everything organized remotely so you can make a
                confident decision from out of town.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What about pets, parking, and building rules?</strong><br />
                Those rules can vary wildly. We’ll confirm policies early so you don’t waste time touring places that
                won’t work for your lifestyle.
