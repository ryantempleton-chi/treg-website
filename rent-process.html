              A clear, efficient rental process — so you know what to expect from first conversation through move-in,
              and you’re never guessing what happens next.

        <section class="section">
          <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-heading">clarity in a fast-moving market</h2>

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              Chicago rentals move quickly, and every building, landlord, and listing can handle things a little
              differently. Our role is to bring structure to that chaos — so you stay organized and confident, even when
              the market is moving fast.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here’s the general process we follow with rental clients. We’ll adjust the pace based on your timing,
              whether you’re moving in a few weeks or planning ahead.

            <ol style="padding-left: 1.1rem; max-width: 820px;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 1: Initial consult</strong><br />
                We’ll talk through your ideal move-in date, budget, preferred neighborhoods, and must-haves — things
                like pets, parking, in-unit laundry, amenities, and building type.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 2: Search setup &amp; strategy</strong><br />
                Based on your criteria, we’ll outline realistic options and set expectations for what you’re likely to
                find in your price range. We’ll also talk about timing — how far in advance to look and how quickly
                good options tend to go.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 3: Curating properties</strong><br />
                We’ll identify listings that actually fit what you’re looking for, rather than sending you every single
                option. You’ll get organized lists instead of scattered links from multiple sites.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 4: Scheduling and touring</strong><br />
                We’ll coordinate showings with buildings, landlords, and listing agents — stacking appointments together
                when possible so you can see multiple places in one efficient outing.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 5: Comparing options</strong><br />
                As you tour, we’ll help you compare each place based on layout, building rules, commute, relative value,
                and how it fits your priorities. You’ll get honest feedback, not sales pressure.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 6: Applying for a unit</strong><br />
                Once you’re ready to move forward, we’ll walk you through the application process — what each building
                or landlord requires, typical fees, and how to present your application clearly and completely.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 7: Approval, deposits, and lease</strong><br />
                We’ll help you understand approval timelines, security deposits or move-in fees, and key lease terms.
                You’ll know what you’re signing and what to expect before and after move-in.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 8: Final logistics &amp; move-in</strong><br />
                We’ll make sure you’re clear on move-in procedures, elevator reservations (if applicable), utilities
                setup, and any building-specific rules that matter for day one.

              <p>
                The “sweet spot” for most Chicago rentals is usually 30–60 days before your ideal move-in date — but
                it’s never too early to ask questions or start planning.
