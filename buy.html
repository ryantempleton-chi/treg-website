            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              Buying a home in Chicago can feel fast, competitive, and confusing — especially if it’s your first time or
              your first move in a while. Our job is to slow things down just enough so you can make smart decisions
              without missing opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’ll start with the basics: your budget, ideal timeline, and what “success” looks like for you. From
              there, we’ll talk through neighborhoods, property types, and trade-offs — condo vs. single-family, city vs.
              suburbs, newer construction vs. character homes, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout the search, you can expect clear communication, straightforward feedback, and honest opinions
              when you ask for them. We’d rather point out the reasons <em>not</em> to buy something than push you
              toward the wrong home.

              From classic city neighborhoods to nearby suburbs, the Templeton Real Estate Group helps you compare your
              options with real numbers and real-world perspective.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maybe you’re deciding between a condo in Lake View, a walk-up in Lincoln Park, or a single-family home
              farther west. Maybe you’re torn between staying in the city or trading square footage for a backyard in
              the suburbs. We’ll walk through the pros, cons, and long-term implications of each move so you can choose
              what fits your life now — and where you’re heading next.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not sure where to begin? Our neighborhood guides are a great starting point, and we’re always happy to
