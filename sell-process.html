              A step-by-step framework to prepare, price, and present your home — with clear expectations and support
              from first walkthrough to closing day.

        <section class="section">
          <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-heading">a structured process for a smoother sale</h2>

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              No two homes or sellers are the same, but a strong process creates consistency. Our approach is built
              around preparation, presentation, and communication — so you always know where things stand.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below is the general outline we follow with sellers. We’ll tailor each step based on your property, your
              timing, and your goals, whether you’re selling a condo in the city or a single-family home in the
              suburbs.

            <ol style="padding-left: 1.1rem; max-width: 820px;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 1: Initial conversation &amp; property review</strong><br />
                We’ll talk through your goals, timing, and what’s driving your move. Then we’ll review your property —
                either virtually or in person — to understand condition, layout, and standout features.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 2: Pricing strategy &amp; market overview</strong><br />
                Using recent comparable sales, current competition, and broader market context, we’ll recommend a
                pricing strategy that aligns with your goals. You’ll see data and hear honest perspective so you can
                make an informed decision.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 3: Prep, repairs, and presentation</strong><br />
                We’ll identify which updates or touch-ups are worth doing — and which ones aren’t. This might include
                decluttering, minor repairs, paint, light staging, or simply better furniture placement and styling.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 4: Photos, marketing, and listing launch</strong><br />
                Once the home is ready, we’ll coordinate professional photography and craft listing copy that tells the
                right story. Your home will be positioned thoughtfully on the MLS and major consumer platforms, with a
                focus on first impressions.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 5: Showings &amp; feedback</strong><br />
                We’ll manage showings and keep you updated on activity and feedback. If the market response suggests
                adjustments — to price, presentation, or terms — we’ll talk through options and make changes together.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 6: Offers &amp; negotiation</strong><br />
                When offers come in, we’ll break down the full picture: price, contingencies, timing, and strength of
                the buyer. We’ll help you weigh the options and negotiate in a way that protects your interests while
                keeping the deal moving forward.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 7: Attorney review, inspection, and appraisal</strong><br />
                After going under contract, we’ll guide you through attorney review and inspection. We’ll help you
                understand what’s typical, what’s reasonable to negotiate, and how to navigate any requests or issues
                that come up — including appraisal.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 8: Final details &amp; closing</strong><br />
                As closing approaches, we’ll help coordinate logistics, final walkthrough, and any remaining items on
                the checklist. The goal is simple: fewer surprises, less stress, and a smooth handoff of keys.

              <p>
                You don’t have to be “ready tomorrow” to start the conversation. In many cases, the best results come
                from connecting early — so we can help you plan prep, pricing, and timing in a way that feels calm and
                intentional.
