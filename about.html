              A Chicago-based boutique real estate team helping clients buy, sell, and rent across the city and suburbs —
              with modern marketing, clear communication, and service that feels personal from start to finish.

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              The Templeton Real Estate Group was created with a simple idea: combine the reach and resources of a major
              brokerage with the care, creativity, and follow-through of a boutique team.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our clients come to us at every stage of life — renting their first Chicago apartment, buying a condo or
              single-family home, upsizing, downsizing, or relocating to a new neighborhood or suburb. No matter the
              price point or property type, the goal is the same: make the process feel clear, calm, and intentional.
            </p>

            <p>
