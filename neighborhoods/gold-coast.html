                  Stately homes, tree-lined streets, and classic buildings give the neighborhood a timeless character.
                  Residents enjoy quick access to the Lakefront Trail, Oak Street Beach, and nearby shopping and dining
                  along Rush Street, Oak Street, and Michigan Avenue.

                  residential, with a strong sense of history and architecture that sets it apart from other downtown
                  neighborhoods.
