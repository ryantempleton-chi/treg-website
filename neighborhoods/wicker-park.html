              Wicker Park is a destination neighborhood — busy and energetic around its main corridors, with quieter,
              residential pockets just a few blocks away.

                  Along Milwaukee, Damen, and North Avenue, you’ll find restaurants, bars, shops, and music venues that
                  draw people from across the city. It’s one of the most active areas on the Northwest Side, especially
                  on weekends and evenings.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Residential streets branching off the main corridors offer a mix of classic Chicago housing and newer
                  construction, providing options for both renters and longer-term owners who want to stay close to the
                  action.
