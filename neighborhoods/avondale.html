            <p class="section-lede">
              Avondale offers a comfortable, residential feel while still being connected to the rest of the city — with
              a growing lineup of local spots and easy access to nearby hot spots.

                <p>
                  Many blocks in Avondale feel like classic Chicago — tree-lined streets, brick two-flats, and longtime
                  residents mixed with newer arrivals. Over the years, more restaurants, coffee shops, and breweries have
                  opened in and around the neighborhood, adding energy without overwhelming the residential core.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Its location along the Blue Line and close to the expressway makes it appealing for commuters who want
                  to balance city access with a quieter home base and more space for their budget.
