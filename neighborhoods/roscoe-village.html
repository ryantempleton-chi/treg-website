              Roscoe Village feels like a smaller town tucked into the city — with a walkable main stretch, friendly
              energy, and a slower pace than some busier nearby neighborhoods.
            </p>

                  Roscoe Street acts as the neighborhood’s heart, with restaurants, cafés, boutiques, and local
                  businesses that draw neighbors out on foot. Seasonal events and street festivals add to the
                  community-oriented feel.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Just off the main corridor, tree-lined streets feature a mix of classic Chicago two-flats, condos, and
                  single-family homes — many with front porches, backyards, and a comfortable residential feel.
