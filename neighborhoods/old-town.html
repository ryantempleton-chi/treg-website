                  Wells Street acts as the main commercial corridor, filled with restaurants, bars, shops, and outdoor
                  patios that stay active throughout the year. Just a few steps off the main roads, quieter streets
                  showcase vintage buildings, classic walk-ups, and thoughtfully restored homes.
