              Life in River North moves quickly. By day, you’ll see professionals heading to offices downtown or
              working from cafés; by night, the neighborhood turns into a destination for dining, nightlife, and
              rooftop views of the skyline.

                <p>
                  River North is one of Chicago’s most urban-feeling neighborhoods, with glass towers, hotel bars,
                  galleries, and restaurants lining the main streets. The Riverwalk, Michigan Avenue, and the Loop are
                  all just a short walk away, making it especially appealing for those who want to minimize their
                  commute and maximize their time in the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the energy, there are pockets of calm on side streets and near the river, where you can step
                  back from the noise without leaving the neighborhood. It’s a strong fit if you want amenities,
                  convenience, and a city skyline out your window.
