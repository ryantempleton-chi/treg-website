              West Loop is known for its restaurant scene, converted warehouses, and energetic streets — a neighborhood
              that feels modern, polished, and very Chicago.

                  Randolph Street and Fulton Market are the heart of the neighborhood, lined with award-winning
                  restaurants, cocktail bars, rooftops, and cafés. The area has become a destination for both locals and
                  visitors, while still offering pockets that feel residential and livable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Just off the main corridors, you’ll find quieter streets with loft buildings, condo developments, and
                  newer rentals. Parks, dog-friendly spaces, and grocery stores continue to make West Loop more
                  convenient year after year.
