        <h2>Life in West Loop</h2>
        <p>
          Once a warehouse and industrial corridor, West Loop has transformed into one of Chicago’s most
          in-demand neighborhoods. Restaurant Row on Randolph, Fulton Market, and a steady wave of new openings
          give the area an energy that’s hard to beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          By day, proximity to the Loop and nearby office hubs makes West Loop especially popular with
          professionals who want a short commute. By night, patios, rooftops, and destination dining keep the
          neighborhood buzzing.
