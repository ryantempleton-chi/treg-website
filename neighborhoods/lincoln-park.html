              Lincoln Park offers the best of both worlds — lakefront parks and quieter residential pockets, plus busy
              commercial corridors with restaurants, bars, and shops.

                  Residents enjoy easy access to the lakefront trail, Lincoln Park Zoo, and multiple parks and green
                  spaces. At the same time, areas along Clark, Halsted, and Armitage bring energy with dining, retail,
                  and neighborhood staples.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The neighborhood is popular with a wide range of residents, from first-time renters to long-term
                  homeowners, thanks to its mix of housing types and proximity to downtown, the lake, and other North
                  Side neighborhoods.
