                  Along Damen, Armitage, and surrounding streets, you’ll find boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants, and
                  neighborhood bars. Side streets tend to be calm and residential, with a mix of classic Chicago
                  architecture and newer construction.

                <p>

                  owners who want a balance of lifestyle and convenience.
