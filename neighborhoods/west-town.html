                  Village, Noble Square, East Village, and more — offering restaurants, bars, local shops, galleries,
                  and a mix of walk-ups, condos, lofts, and single-family homes.

              West Town blends neighborhood charm with creative energy — offering a mix of dining, nightlife, and
              residential streets that feel distinctly local.

                  Across its different pockets, you’ll find everything from longstanding institutions to new
                  restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. Galleries, boutiques, and local businesses add to the creative,
                  independent feel of the area.

                <p>
                  Many blocks feel comfortably residential, with classic Chicago housing stock and a slower pace than
                  some busier nearby neighborhoods — while still offering quick access to downtown, Wicker Park, the
                  West Loop, and Logan Square.

                  How the Templeton Real Estate Group helps
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Because West Town covers several smaller areas, pricing and feel can vary from block to block. The
                  Templeton Real Estate Group helps you understand those micro-neighborhoods — so you know exactly what
                  you’re getting.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whether you’re renting or buying, we’ll help you compare West Town to nearby neighborhoods like
                  Wicker Park, Ukrainian Village, Humboldt Park, and the West Loop — so you can choose the area that
                  matches your lifestyle.
