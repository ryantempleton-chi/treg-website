              West Town is a collection of neighborhoods — including Ukrainian Village,
              East Village, and Noble Square — known for classic flats, creative energy,
              and easy access to downtown.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Life in West Town</h2>
            <p class="section-lede">
              West Town feels residential and creative at the same time — a patchwork of
              distinct pockets with restaurants, bars, and quiet streets just blocks apart.
            </p>

            <p>
              Housing is dominated by vintage two- and three-flats, worker cottages,
              greystones, and newer condo developments. Commercial corridors along Chicago,
              Division, and Western continue to grow with local favorites.
            </p>

            <p>
              With Blue Line access and quick routes into the West Loop and downtown,
              West Town is frequently cross-shopped with Wicker Park, Logan Square,
              and River West.
