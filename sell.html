              A strategic, step-by-step approach to selling — from pricing and prep to marketing, showings, and offers —
              with a focus on clarity, communication, and strong presentation.

            <h2 class="section-heading">selling with a plan, not guesswork</h2>

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              A great sale doesn’t start with a sign in the yard or a listing going live — it starts with a clear
              strategy. We’ll look at your goals, your timing, and the story of your home, then build a plan that feels
              realistic and intentional.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together, we’ll review recent comparable sales, local trends, and your home’s condition to arrive at a
              pricing and prep strategy that makes sense. From there, we’ll talk through what to fix, what to feature,
              and what can stay as-is — so you’re investing your time and money in the right places.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once we go live, you’ll know what to expect: how showings will work, how feedback will be handled, and
              how we’ll adjust if the market speaks differently than the data did.

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              Whether your property is in a classic Chicago neighborhood or just outside the city, we’ll help you
              position it thoughtfully within the broader market.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’ll talk through how your home compares to nearby listings and recent sales — and how buyers are
              currently behaving in your price bracket. From there, we’ll decide together how to show up competitively
              while still honoring your goals for timeline and bottom line.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you’re also buying a new home, we’ll help you coordinate both sides of the move so the process feels
              as smooth as possible.
