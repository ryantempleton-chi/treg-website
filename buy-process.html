              A clear, step-by-step path from first conversation to closing — built to help you feel organized,
              informed, and confident at every stage of your home search.

          <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-heading">a simple framework for a big decision</h2>

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              Every buyer’s situation is different — but the framework we use stays consistent. Our goal is to give you
              clear expectations, honest guidance, and a roadmap you can actually follow, without getting lost in the
              noise.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below is the high-level process we walk through with our buyers. Think of it as your template — we’ll
              adjust the timeline, pace, and focus based on your budget, life stage, and how quickly you’re hoping to
              move.

            <ol style="padding-left: 1.1rem; max-width: 820px;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 1: Start with a conversation</strong><br />
                We’ll talk through your budget, ideal timing, preferred neighborhoods, and what “a win” looks like for
                you. This is also where we answer your big-picture questions about the market, process, and next steps.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 2: Align on budget &amp; pre-approval</strong><br />
                If you’re financing, we’ll help you connect with a trusted lender (or collaborate with your preferred
                one) to get pre-approved. This shapes your search and gives you real numbers to work with — not just
                guesses from an online calculator.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 3: Refine neighborhoods &amp; property type</strong><br />
                Together, we’ll compare neighborhoods, building styles, and property types — condo vs. single-family,
                city vs. suburbs, newer vs. vintage, and more. You’ll get a realistic sense of what’s available at your
                price point in different areas.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 4: Curate and tour homes</strong><br />
                We’ll send you properties that actually fit your criteria — not just everything that hits the market.
                From there, we’ll schedule tours in a way that makes sense with your schedule, grouping showings to make
                the most of your time.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 5: Evaluate and compare your options</strong><br />
                As you see homes, we’ll talk through the pros, cons, and trade-offs of each one. We’ll look at price,
                location, condition, building health, and future resale potential — and we’ll be honest if something
                feels off.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 6: Craft a strategy &amp; write the offer</strong><br />
                When you’re ready to move forward, we’ll walk you through recent comparable sales, recommended pricing,
                and offer terms. We’ll tailor the offer to the home and the situation — whether it calls for a stronger
                price, cleaner terms, or more creative structure.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 7: Attorney review &amp; inspection</strong><br />
                Once your offer is accepted, we’ll guide you through inspection and attorney review. We’ll help you
                understand inspection findings, discuss what’s normal, and work with your attorney to negotiate any
                requested repairs or credits.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 8: Final steps &amp; closing day</strong><br />
                As you approach closing, we’ll help coordinate final details: lender conditions, appraisal, final
                walkthrough, and logistics for move-in. By the time you get the keys, you’ll know exactly what to
                expect.

              <p>
                You don’t have to have everything figured out to start the conversation. In fact, some of the best
                results come when we connect early — before you’re ready to “pull the trigger” — so we can help you map
                out a realistic timeline and game plan.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whether you’re six months out, just starting to research neighborhoods, or already pre-approved and
                ready to tour, we’ll meet you where you are and build from there.
