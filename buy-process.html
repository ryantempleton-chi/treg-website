        <section class="section">
          <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-heading">a simple framework for a big decision</h2>

            <p class="section-lede" style="max-width: 780px;">
              Every buyer’s situation is different — but the framework we use stays consistent. Our goal is to give you
              clear expectations, honest guidance, and a roadmap you can actually follow, without getting lost in the
              noise.
            </p>

            <p style="max-width: 880px;">
              Below is the high-level process we walk through with our buyers. Think of it as your template — we’ll
              adjust the timeline, pace, and focus based on your budget, life stage, and how quickly you’re hoping to
              move.
            </p>

          <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-heading">step-by-step: buying with the templeton real estate group</h2>

            <ol style="padding-left: 1.1rem; max-width: 820px;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 1: Start with a conversation</strong><br />
                We’ll talk through your budget, ideal timing, preferred neighborhoods, and what “a win” looks like for
                you — plus any big-picture questions about the market, the process, and what happens next.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 2: Align on budget &amp; pre-approval</strong><br />
                If you’re financing, we’ll help you connect with a trusted lender (or coordinate with yours) to get
                pre-approved. This creates real numbers to shop with — not guesses from an online calculator.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 3: Refine neighborhoods &amp; property type</strong><br />
                Together, we’ll compare neighborhoods, building styles, and trade-offs — condo vs. single-family, city
                vs. suburbs, newer vs. vintage, and more — so you understand what’s realistic in your price range.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 4: Curate and tour homes</strong><br />
                We’ll send you options that actually fit your criteria (not everything that hits the market), then
                schedule tours in efficient windows so you can see more with less chaos.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 5: Evaluate and compare your options</strong><br />
                As you tour, we’ll talk through what matters: price vs. value, location, condition, building health,
                and future resale. You’ll get honest feedback — including when something feels off.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 6: Craft a strategy &amp; write the offer</strong><br />
                When you’re ready, we’ll review comps, recommend pricing, and tailor terms to the specific home and
                situation — whether that means stronger price, cleaner contingencies, or creative structure.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 7: Attorney review &amp; inspection</strong><br />
                Once accepted, we’ll guide you through inspection and attorney review. We’ll help you interpret
                findings, understand what’s normal, and negotiate repairs or credits when appropriate.
              </li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1.1rem;">
                <strong>Step 8: Final steps &amp; closing day</strong><br />
                We’ll coordinate the details leading up to closing — lender conditions, appraisal, final walkthrough,
                and move logistics — so closing day feels calm and predictable.
              </li>

              <p>
                You don’t have to have everything figured out to start the conversation. In fact, some of the best
                results come when we connect early — before you’re ready to move — so we can help you map out a
                realistic timeline and game plan.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whether you’re six months out, researching neighborhoods, or already pre-approved and ready to tour,
                we’ll meet you where you are and build from there.

          <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-heading">common buying questions</h2>

            <div style="max-width: 860px;">
              <p>
                <strong>When should we start the process?</strong><br />
                Ideally 60–90 days before you want to be under contract. If you’re earlier than that, we can still help
                you map out neighborhoods, budget, and timing so you’re ready when the right home comes up.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Do I need a lender before touring?</strong><br />
                Not always — but a lender conversation early helps you shop with real numbers and move quickly when you
                find the right place. We can recommend trusted lenders or coordinate with yours.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>How competitive is the market right now?</strong><br />
                It varies by neighborhood, price point, and property type. We’ll give you a realistic read on leverage,
                days on market, and what terms typically win — so your strategy fits the specific home.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What costs should I plan for beyond the down payment?</strong><br />
                Typical items include lender fees, appraisal, title, attorney fees, prepaid taxes/insurance, and
                closing costs. We’ll help you understand ranges early so you’re not surprised later.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What happens if the inspection finds issues?</strong><br />
                We’ll help you separate normal wear-and-tear from real concerns, then work with your attorney to
                negotiate repairs or credits when appropriate.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Can you help if I’m buying from out of town?</strong><br />
                Yes — we can preview homes, coordinate virtual tours, and keep everything organized remotely so you can
                make confident decisions without flying in for every showing.
