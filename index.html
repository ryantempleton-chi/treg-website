            <p class="section-lede">
              Ryan Templeton is the Lead Broker &amp; Founder of the Templeton Real Estate Group — a boutique Chicago
              team built on relationships, not transactions. With nearly a decade of experience helping clients buy,
              sell, and rent across the city, Ryan brings a calm, organized, and straightforward approach to every
              move.
            </p>
            <p>
              From first-time renters planning their very first lease to buyers and sellers navigating their next big
              chapter, Ryan’s focus is on clarity, communication, and long-term trust. When he’s not working with
              clients, you’ll often find him exploring new neighborhoods, checking out Chicago’s restaurant scene, or
              taking in whatever the city has to offer — from seasonal events to game days and everything in between.
